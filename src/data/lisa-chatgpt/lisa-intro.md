Well-being and mental health are fundamental components of children's development and their educational success. Yet, more than one in four children face challenges such as neurodevelopmental and learning disorders (like [Specific Learning Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_disability), [Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum), [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), etc.), [mood disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder) (like anxiety, depression), or [emotional and behavioral disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_and_behavioral_disorders).

In the absence of detection and intervention, these challenges often lead to severe consequences for the child and those around them: lack of interest, dropping out, bullying, violence, suicidal actions...

The LISA research-action program provides educational stakeholders with tools to identify, understand, and collaborate, to support each child, both in and outside of school, based on their strengths and needs. Co-constructed by teachers, families, researchers, clinicians, and other educational actors, LISA develops a community, a training program, and a digital platform.

LISA is originally developed and prototyped in France, initiated by [iféa](https://ifea.education), a network of innovative schools, and the [Learning Planet Institute](https://www.learningplanetinstitute.org/). LISA is developed Under the supervision of its scientific committee, including [Ariel B. Lindner](https://www.learningplanetinstitute.org/en/biography-of-ariel-lindner/), [Bennett L. Leventhal](https://childmind.org/bio/bennett-leventhal-md/), [Richard Delorme](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/experts/richard-delorme), [Bruno Falissard](https://cesp.inserm.fr/fr/agent/falissard), [Caroline Huron](https://www.reseau-canope.fr/conseil-scientifique-de-leducation-nationale-site-officiel/presentation/membres-du-csen/caroline-huron.html), [Yasser Kazhaal](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1019016&LanCode=8), and others; a dedicated team including [Anirudh Krishnakumar](https://mindlogger.org/anirudh-krishnakumar.html), [Naima Page](https://ifea.education/a-propos-ifea/), [Kseniia Konischeva](https://matter.childmind.org/kseniia-konishcheva.html), [Arno Klein](https://childmind.org/bio/arno-klein-phd/), and others; and key partner institutions including the [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/), [INSERM U1284](https://appliweb.dgri.education.fr/rnsr/PresenteStruct.jsp?numNatStruct=202023562D), [CléPsy](https://www.clepsy.fr/), and the [Robert Debré Hospital](https://www.aphp.fr/service/service-20-070) in Paris.

The project has [received support from the French government](https://www.education.gouv.fr/france-2030-11-nouveaux-laureats-de-l-appel-manifestation-d-interet-innovation-dans-la-forme-378485) to be deployed in 200 schools within the [Académie de Créteil, Académie de Paris, Académie de Versaille](https://www.ac-paris.fr/RAIDF), and the [Mission laïque française](https://www.mlfmonde.org/qui-est-la-mission-laique-francaise/).

LISA aims to provide stakeholders in the education of children and adolescents with evidence-based, actionable, and accessible training and guidance in the process of identifying and supporting their unique strengths and needs. As part of this effort, LISA is building a database of resources, Lisapedia.
